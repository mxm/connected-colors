connected-colors
================

Connected colors is a algorithm riddle which I read about somewhere on the
Internet but forgot where exactly. Nevertheless, it would be nice to solve this
problem.

Given a grid (nxm) filled with colors, return a map of all colors inside the
grid with their maximum number of connected occurrences.

A color of a cell is connected if another neighboring cell contains the same
color.

Example
-------

```
R, B, Y, B, R
B, Y, Y, R, Y
R, B, Y, B, B
R, B, Y, R, Y
```

Output:

```
B=4
R=2
Y=5
```
